						<h3>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?</h3>
						<p>
							The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel west?
							Why did Marco Polo head east? Because it is that pull, that
							unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans to seek
							new frontiers to explore.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure. Imagine
							living on another planet, millions of miles from the Earth;
							looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of the 'stars'
							is actually the planet you were born on. Who can even envision the
							incredible feeling of being the first human in history to step out
							of the capsule and leave your footprint on the surface of Mars? By
							this we implore you to not just think of that feeling for the
							astronaut, but the experience for all those watching back home.
							Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on the Moon all those years
							ago still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were
							with and how they felt. The moment the first astronauts land on
							Mars will be our moment to remember.
						</p>
						<p>
							A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars
							come from? Can it teach us about Earth's history? Is there life on
							Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of burning questions
							for scientists all over the world. .

						<h3>Is this trip risky?</h3>
						<p>
							The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in
							any means of travel, there are always things that could go wrong.
							In the case of Mars One, the following risks are conceivable:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Accident(s) during launch</li>
							<li>Vital components could malfunction</li>
							<li>There could be problems when landing</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you were
							to compare our mission to the first Moon mission in 1969, it
							quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.

						<h3>What to do there?</h3>
						<p>
							During the working hours, the astronauts will be busy performing
							three main tasks: construction, maintenance and research. Besides
							work, they will also have time to relax.

						<h3>How long does it take to travel to Mars?</h3>
						<p>
							The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts
							currently stay on the International Space Station.
						</p>
						<p>
							The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is taken.
							Because both Mars and Earth's orbits are not perfectly circular,
							the time it takes to travel between them varies from six to eight
							months.
						</p>
						<p>
							When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time for
							the astronauts is very important.
